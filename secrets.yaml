# This file is only used for local development. It can be used to store your secret values.
# When you trigger the transformer using the CLI, this file will be automatically parsed, and the secrets values will be passed to the transformer.
# The secrets must match the secrets defined in your data-product.yaml
#
# Be aware that you might be storing sensitive data in plain text. For better security you can leave this file empty (or only use it for non-sensitive data).
# The CLI will prompt you for the missing secret values.

# Never commit this file!
